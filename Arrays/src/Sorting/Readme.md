Binary Array - Partition using QuickSort using lomato, hoare and naive algorithm  
Array of size n with small ranges - use counting sort, time complexity is O(N+K) and space complexity is O(K)  
Array of size n with large ranges as array element - Radix sort, Time complexity is O(N) and space complexity is O(N)  
Array with uniformly distributed ranges - Bucket sort  
When memory writes are costly - selection and Cycle sort  
when adjacent swaps are allowed - Bubble sort, Cocktail sort is better than bubble sort  
When array is small - Selection & Insertion Sort (Insertion sort is best)  
When available extra memory is less - Shall sort  
  
General purpose sorting algo  
Merge sort - Good for linked list and it is considered as stable sort  
Heap sort  
Quick sort  
Hybrid Algo  
TimSort - Used in python is a combination of insertion and merge sort  
IntroSort - Quick, Heap and Insertion sort. Used in C++
